During an incident response procedure, there are 2 things that we must quickly evaluate.

Is there currently a user in the system that should not be there?
Has a user been created during the attack and deleted after that?

Here are the following notes when comes to deal with supicious user detection:

"net user" on CMD or "get-localuser" on PowerShell will list all the users

“net user USERNAME”  gives a detailed information 
regarding this specific user if there is a supicious user.

Another method is to maintain control through “lusrmgr”. For this, 
activate “run: with “Windows + R” and click OK by typing “lusrmgr.msc”
In the window that pops up, there are the “Users” group and list the users.

Users That Have Been Created in The Past:
Filter it in the security log, EventId "4720".
